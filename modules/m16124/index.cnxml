<title>Problem Statement</title>
<para id="psp1">

The ability to image sketches hidden by layers of paint is a
valuable asset to art purchasers in their attempts to
exhaustively examine the works they collect.  Art conservators
value a painting's underdrawings for two main reasons.  The first
is that underdrawings can be exploited as an aid in determining
whether the painting is an original or a forgery, by comparing
the style of the underdrawings to those of an artist's other
works.  The second is that comparisons between a painting and its
own underdrawing can give new insights into an artist's creative
process for that work of art.  Underdrawing images are best
revealed by near infrared (NIR) cameras because all paint
pigments, except black, are somewhat transparent in the 900 - 1700 nm range<cite target-id="richards-03"/>.  However, current NIR cameras
that are sensitive in this wavelength range are exorbitantly
expensive, typically costing around $50,000<cite target-id="lichty-email"/>.
This leaves the market of small art museums and individual art
collectors unaddressed.  We intend to deliver an NIR camera that
meets or exceeds key imaging system parameters in this market,
such as spectral range, image resolution, capture time, and
portability, while also reducing cost below the $5,000 level.

<title>Background</title>
<para id="bgp1">

Before the 1960s, there was only one way to examine a painting's
underdrawing: the layers of paint in front of the underdrawing had to
be removed, thereby destroying the painting in the process.  This was
unacceptable for multiple reasons.  Since underdrawings are typically
of less interest than the finished painting, removing the layers of
paint on top is not justified.  Also, many interesting results come
from a detailed comparison between the original painting and its
underdrawing.  This comparison is difficult if the paint layers must
be destroyed to access the underdrawing.
</para>

<para id="bgp2">
J. R. J. van Asperen de Boer was the first to image underdrawings
using NIR reflectography in 1968 <cite target-id="boer-68"/>.  Previous
attempts had used an NIR camera to passively capture light in
that range.  However, with passive capture it was difficult to
see through pigments such as green, since most of the light
collected was in the range of 750 - 900 nm, which is below the
range where those colors are transparent.  Boer solved this
problem by capturing the reflected light from a tungsten lamp
that produced radiation of wavelengths up to 2500 nm, giving a
much clearer image of the underdrawing.  While Boer's design has
been improved in numerous ways during the past four decades, it
remains fundamental to most techniques for imaging underdrawings
nondestructively.
</para>

<para id="bgp3">
<link target-id="ren"/> and <link target-id="laib"/> below are examples of
comparisons between original paintings and their underdrawings as
captured with a typical modern NIR camera.  In <link target-id="ren"/>,
the underdrawing shows that the man in the top hat, the artist's
accountant, was initially looking towards the viewer, but later
this changed so that he looked away, purportedly because of
disagreements between the two men <cite target-id="sensorsinc"/>.  In <link target-id="laib"/>, a large arrow can be seen on the chest of a horse on
the underdrawing of a painting by Laib.  This arrow is absent
from the overlaid painted image.

Unfortunately, conventional NIR cameras that cover the spectral
range required for a clear image of underdrawings typically cost
from $30,000 to $50,000.  By reducing the cost of the NIR
camera, underdrawings could be examined by a much larger set of
universities, museums, and collectors.  This opens numerous
opportunities to gain deeper insight into both the creative
process and the history of artwork.

The spectral range of a camera depends on the type of detectors
it employs.  Thus, whatever the overall structure of our design,
it will have to incorporate a sensor capable of imaging through
paint.  All pigments except black are somewhat transparent in the
900 - 1700 nm range, which can easily be
covered by any NIR detector <cite target-id="richards-03"/>. Even though our problem probably
constrains us to using an NIR detector of some sort, this still
leaves us a variety of options. We will want to choose a detector
that has minimal cost, in order to keep the final camera price
low.  We will also want a detector that is appropriately sized so
that it can easily be physically integrated into our overall
optical system. Additionally, we will need to ensure that any
detector we choose is capable of providing the dynamic range
required for underdrawing imaging. That is, 256 grey levels should be distinguishable in the image <cite target-id="baronti-98"/>.
</para>

<para id="prsp2">
As Boer found in his original experiments with
reflectography, for high-quality underimaging a specialized light
source is necessary, to provide coverage of all relevant
wavelengths in the NIR range <cite target-id="boer-68"/>.  Our system would also need such a
source of radiation.  For this source, or sources, 800 W of power
is a high enough value to give a good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
in standard room temperature conditions <cite target-id="gargano-07"/>.  Using
significantly higher power is not advisable, as most sources will
emit a certain portion of their light in the UV and visible
ranges, and it will be difficult to filter out all of this.
Intense light from these high-energy ranges could damage a
painting during imaging.
</para>

<para id="prsp3">
The image acquisition time when imaging underdrawings is quite
flexible.  While experience with conventional charge-coupled
device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
digital camera technology in the visible range would lead one to
expect image acquisition time on the order of Âµsec, such a
short acquisition time is not critical for this application.  A
relatively small number of images are typically taken with a
static target.  The resulting images are typically subjected to
extensive analysis and comparison with similar images of
underdrawings from the same artist.  When all of these factors
are taken together, a small image acquisition time becomes a nice
extra feature when possible, but is not crucial for success in
this application domain.  Typical systems targeted towards
underdrawing imaging take about 15 minutes to acquire and
process an image due to the mosaicing system used. For the
underdrawing imaging application, the relaxed image acquisition
time requirement makes it possible to consider sacrificing low
acquisition time for improved image quality, improved image
resolution, or reduced camera cost.
</para>

<para id="prsp4">
Portability is a valuable and highly preferred feature for
underdrawing inspection.  For cumbersome systems, or systems that are
difficult to relocate, artwork can be moved to the location of the
camera for inspection.  However, this need for transportation puts the
original artwork at risk for damage.  Since such great care is needed
to move the artwork, a portable camera would be a much better solution
since it removes this potential hazard.  Reducing the risk of damage
to the original artwork is critical because, while it is generally
possible to replace a broken camera, it is impossible to replace the
artwork.
</para>

<para id="prsp5">
While analyzing underdrawings does not directly mandate a
specific image resolution, one must be able to make out the
various lines with reasonable clarity in order to derive
meaningful results.  By image resolution, we mean a pixels / mm
specification for the final reconstructed image of the
underdrawing.  A camera with a low image resolution could be
used, but one would need to take many pictures by zooming in on
small parts of the target. These pieces would later need to be
aligned and stitched together to view the entire underdrawing, a
process which is time consuming and could be quite involved for
the user. A better approach is to use a camera with a larger
image resolution which can capture the entire underdrawing or
areas of interest with only one or several pictures.  According
to our initial research, a system that can provide at least 2
pixels for each mm of target length should be
sufficient <cite target-id="saunders-05"/>. We expect to use our design with small to medium
paintings, as indicated by the average target size of 0.33 m x
0.33 m.  This assumes our system will have a field of view
(angular observable range) comparable with the largest artwork
size.

There are a variety of systems that can be used to image

Five alternatives for the detector component of such cameras were
surveyed by Gargano, Ludwig, and Poldi in their recent comparison of
IR reflectographic systems <cite target-id="gargano-07"/>.  They analyzed CCD Si, FPA InGaAs, FPA
HgCdTe, InSb detectors, and vidicon tubes.  The respective upper
spectral limits for these sensors are 1050 nm, 1700 nm, 2500 nm, 5 nm,
and 2 nm.  Using pigments modeled after those used in the 15-16th
centuries, they measured the pigment transparency that could be
achieved with each sensor.
</para>

<para id="etp3">
Their conclusion is that InGaAs sensors are best, as they achieved
high transparency values and exhibited a large gray range.  However,
this result only holds for underdrawings make with black, carbon-based
drawing implements; since black pigments have only 2% transmittance
in the NIR range, they will not be transparent for any of the five
devices analyzed.  For underdrawings made with iron gall inks, red
crayons, or grayish inks, CCD Si cameras are probably best, since
these substances are usually completely transparent over 1200 nm.
Our project would focus on providing better imaging for black
underdrawings only, since, for imaging other types, the best
system, CCD Si, is already relatively low-cost.
</para>

<para id="etp4">
Current underdrawing imaging systems that use sensors other than
the cheap CCD Si require image scanning to achieve adequate image
resolution.  This is because their sensor arrays are small, on
the order of 320 x 256 pixels; it is not economically feasible to
build larger arrays.  Over the past decades, scanning systems have made advances in precision of
motion control and image assembly <cite target-id="bertani-90"/>. However, in the image
reconstruction process, they still face difficulties with
perfecting image mosaicing.
</para>

<para id="etp5">
The best systems to date resemble the CPS 200E positioning system, which moves the camera while the painting stays
stationary <cite target-id="cps200e"/>. This is advantageous from an art conservation
standpoint, in that it reduces wear on the painting.  The CPS
200E device achieves very accurate motion.  However, accurate
motion alone is not enough to ensure high image quality.  The
complexity of the image mosaicing task also requires very precise
control of lighting and knowledge about the geometric distortion
produced by the exact positioning of the camera in the scanning
frame.  Lighting control can be achieved by imaging an
illumination control card to detect inhomogeneity. Geometric
distortion can be measured by imaging graph paper.  The
information from these two images is then merged with that of the
other images during the mosaicing process.

</figure>

<para id="etp6">
Aside from the camera and positioning system, the lighting
mechanism is the most important element in modern underdrawing
imaging systems. To reduce any damage to a painting, high-energy
light, such as that from the visible and UV ranges, should be
filtered out during imaging. However, the intensity of the light
source must be high, since this value greatly influences the SNR
of the detector.  In one typical imaging setup, a pair of halogen bulbs, each with intensity
in the 400 W is used <cite target-id="burmester-93"/>. The light from these bulbs is passed
through an RG 1000 filter and a BG 39 filter, which sufficiently
reduces high-energy radiation without damaging IR imaging
potential.
</para>

<para id="etp7">
The existing solutions to the various aspects of the underdrawing
imaging problem - NIR detector, camera-painting positioning system,
mosaicing techniques, and illumination schemes - are inadequate.
They combine to make systems which, while cheaper than using a
single huge NIR sensor array to take a single image, derive their
economical advantage partly at the expense of system portability,
accuracy, and simplicity.  We intend to implement a different
alternative to the single huge NIR array.  Our alternative would
improve upon the current solutions by reducing overall system
cost, perhaps not only in monetary terms, but also in terms of
portability, accuracy, or simplicity.  What current systems offer
for $50,000, we intend to match or beat for
under $5,000 <cite target-id="lichty-email"/>.
